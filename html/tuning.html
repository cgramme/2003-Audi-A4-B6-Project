						<p>I try to keep most of the modifications I do to this car geared towards performance rather than flashiness. It's comfortable, quick and unassuming, just as a good daily driver sleeper should be. Below is a list of modifications that set this A4 apart from the rest.<br><br></p>
						<ul class="mod-list">
							<li>Current Modifications:</li>
							<li>T3/T4 T04E Turbocharger</li>
							<li>Cast Iron Turbo Manifold</li>
							<li>630cc EV14 Fuel Injectors</li>
							<li>Front Mount Intercooler</li>
							<li>Custom 93oct Tune</li>
							<li>Custom Downpipe</li>
							<li>Extensive emission system deletes</li>

						<h2>ME7 ECM Tuning</h2>
						<p><span class="left">INTRO:</span>This is a short and sweet overview of how I got into ECM (Electronic Control Module) tuning for the A4 B6. Without the right resources I would be dead in the water had I undertaken this challenge. The crew at nefmoto.com have put together some awesome guides and threads on their forum and I would recomend starting there. While learning there also read through S4wiki.com... maybe a few times.<br><br></p>

						<p><br><br>Tuning is all about manipulating your current hardware via software in the most effective way for your goals. Not everyone has the same goals for their tune. While some (most of us car enthusiast) want maximum performance others want better gas mileage and less polution. However, this is not about MPG or emissions, it is about learning the limitations of your hardware and defining a safe/reliable tune that kicks you in the pants.<br><br></p>
						<div class="line"></div>
						<p><br><span class="left">TUNE:</span>I will start with my current hardware situation. I've upgraded to 630cc EV14 fuel injectors, front mount intercooler, a larger T04E turbocharger, custom downpipe, and a cast iron turbo manifold. I have also deleted and coded out a lot of emissions components and relays such as: catalytic converter, SAI, N249, N112, N80 and P299. The goal of deleting these was to remove vacuum hoses and create more usable space under the hood, along with simplifying the system. Tuning has allowed me to remove all these components and still pass emissions with flying colors.<br><br></p>
						<p><br>I won't go into detail about how to tune the maps myself, instead I'll direct you to the pros at nefmoto.com and advise that you keep reading about how all the systems work. Although, a few maps to mention looking into are LAMFA (air fuel ratio), LDRXN (Load), KFZW (timing) and KFLDHBN (max boost pressure ratio). It is very important to make sure your fueling is correct before making changes to anything. Learn to log with ME7Logger and make changes to your tune with the information you recorded, this is a must for any decent tune.<br><br></p>
						<p><br><span class="left">SETUP:</span>As of now I have the boost pressure set to hold 18psi up to redline, which is a fairly safe amount considering I'm using stock connecting rods. Timing has been inceased up to 6 degrees in some areas with the help of using 93 octane fuel and a front mount intercooler. I've also tuned the new larger turbos PID system with (KFLDIMX) and (KFLDRL), and tuned for the larger fuel injectors via (TVUB) &amp; (KRKTE). Timing was adjusted using the map (KFZW), and pressure ratio was increased by (KFLDHBN). There have been a lot of other changes but I feel these are some of the most important to my tune. You will learn a lot if you just hunker down do your research and take your time.<br><br></p>
