Use a marker to mark the pipes where you need them cut and make sure to cut them at the correct angles so they mate up properly. Keep in mind that the couplers can't grab bends in the pipe very well and will be more prone to popping off under boost. This is greatly hightened if you do not bead the ends of the pipe. Make sure not to try and bend couplers in any way they aren't ment to bend. I ordered an aditional (3) 45 degree couplers so I could do this correctly. My goal was to make the setup as efficient as possible and also minimize all coupler connections. The picture on the left is a general mock up before I received the 45 degree couplers. All in all I am very pleased with how the fitment of the pipes worked out for the A4 B6.</p>
<p><br /><img class="left-pic" src="../images/flare.jpg" alt="piping flare" />The most important thing when doing a universal piping kit is to make sure all connections are secure and will never pop off under boost. Roling the edges is simply the best way to achive this. If you don't have access to a bead roller you can flare the ends of each pipe with a pair of heavy pliers. This is not the best way to do it because the edges of pipe could over time wear through the couplers, so it is important to try and counteract this by rounding the very edge of the pipe back in. It may be overkill but I used two T bolt clamps on a couple that I thought may be problematic. Did I need to, probably not but I feel better about it and I had some spare clamps. There are a few little tricks like spraying the pipe with hairspray (common), I have even heard of people using epoxy along with a clamp for a more permanent seal (I don't recommend this). At the end of the day whatever works works and the important thing is that everything is sealed and NEVER going to blow off under boost.<br /><br /></p>
