<p><img class="right-pic" src="../images/intercooler1.jpg" alt="intercooler finnished" /><span class="left">RESULT:</span>I'm very happy with the way things turned out. My intake temps are WAY down, when it was up to 130 F* at WOT I am now close to ambient air temperatures. This cheap and commonly hated tube and fin design intercooler has exceeded my expectations and proven that it can be a very effective tool in reducing intake air temperatures. I will do some logs of my IAT's and compare to previous logs for some nerd eye candy. Currently I am still using the stock k03s turbo, but there are plans of upgrading to a T3/T4 .63 .50 turbo in the near future. I hope this DIY will help you or someone else with their install or decision if a universal kit is the right choice for your application.<br><br></p>
