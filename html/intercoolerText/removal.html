There should be (3) bolts on each side of the bumper. Some people say it is easier to get them off by removing the fender lining and using an extension. I on the other hand have done it that way and found it is MUCH easier to remove the headlights and remove them from above. after removing the bumper bolts you will need to remove two more hex bolts that are located close to the fog lights. Remove the fog light cover vents to get to the hex bolts. Now take the bumper off and be careful not to damage any of the wiring or hoses that are attached. You can remove the wiring and hoses or just kinda angle you bumper out of the way while you work, which is what I did.</p>
<p><br/><img class="right-pic" src="../images/intercoolerFit.jpg" alt="intercooler fitment" />I fitted the intercooler before removing any of the stock intercooler piping. 3/4" copper tubes worked perfectly for making a custom mount for the intercooler. I used a hammer to flatted them at the ends at the right angles and then used some large pliers to bend them to fit correctly. Some people might wait until after they plumb all the new piping to trim the bumper to make room for the new intercooler, but I wanted to get it out of the way and make sure it fits before getting in too deep. I used a 3" cut off wheel to remove any part of the bumper that was in the way (more on this later). With everything mounted and fitting under the bumper it was time to remove all of the stock intercooler rubbish. Just follow from the turbo to the intake manifold and remove all the rubber piping. the piping under the radiator is actually part of the radiator support and can't be removed. Next remove the stock intercooler by removing the bolts that hold it in place. I was able to get it loose and finagle it around until it could be removed.<br /><br /></p>
