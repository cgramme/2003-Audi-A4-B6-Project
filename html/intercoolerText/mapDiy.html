I didn't want to get another piece just for the sensor to fit and I didn't want to add any more coupler connections. I decided to chop up the stock intercooler and fab up the sensor mount to fit on my piping. I cut a hole just big enough for the sensor to fit into and then sanded the plastic mount to the round shape of the piping for a solid flush fitment. To get the rounded flush fitment I wrapped a piece of piping in coarse sandpaper and sanded until it had a nice flush contact area with the piping (took me about 45 minutes to sand).  I then taped around where the mount was mocked up and sanded the piping down in that area. I used a very strong epoxy to glue the mount on and held it in place with tape until it dried. I like the fitment of it, right under the throttle body and out of view. This has been holding up very well so far. Boost is currently at 15-16 psi with spikes up to 20 psi.<br /><br /></p>
