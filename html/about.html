				<h2>About</h2>
				<div class="main-text">
					<p>I bought a 2003 Audi A4 B6 1.8T Quattro automatic transmission (Tiptronic) July of 2014. The car had 135,000mi as I bought it and now has 146,000mi on the chassis. This is my first auto transmission out of my last six cars I've owned and possibly my last... I thought this would give me an oprotune time to make a 'sleeper' and see how cheap I could do it. Since I don't want to put much money into the car I research for the cheapest, tried and true parts for the build. I also do all the work myself which helps me save my pennies.<br><br></p>
					<p><span class="left">GOALS:</span>My goal for the car is to make reliable power utilizing the stock transmission and engine. This should put me circa 350hp at the crank and 275hp wheel. The limitations of the build are the rods which tend to bend above 400 crank hp. Altogether, I want a comfortable daily driver that can kick me back in the seat and have fun getting where I'm going.<br><br><br></p>
